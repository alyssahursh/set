## Why did you build this?
* Our assignment was to build tic-tac-toe as a single-page application, but I couldn't make sense of the instruction

## If I had more time
* I'd fix the responsiveness of the site, so that you can resize the screen without unexpected behavior.
* I'd add the ability to score points and game wins by player.
